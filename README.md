## How to update team members data

- team member's data is present in [about.ts](content/about.ts) file.
- as it changes only once per academic year, it doesn't make any sense to store it in supabase.
- you will see a lot of variable exports.
- follow the schema and update them accordingly.
- image path can be from supabase or a relative path to [this file](app/about/Team.tsx).
